## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Visual debt closure and Phase 4 groundwork
  ([spec](docs/specs/2026-08-09-visual-debt-design.md)): design.md type-scale tokens,
  reduced-motion policy that keeps color/opacity, shared `DamgaMark`, token-themed sonner
  toasts with retry actions, elevation tokens, shared 48px topbar, workspace switcher
  dropdown (usable from the collapsed rail), sliding sancak rail, shell loading skeleton,
  auth screens on the identity system (Fraunces display + damga + ui primitives), board
  column stagger on first paint, board card hover/focus states, and a11y fixes
  (`aria-current`, `menuitemradio` switcher, `main` landmark).
- Phase 3 boards and columns: workspace-scoped board/column CRUD, default columns on
  board create, Float fractional column reordering with on-demand rebalance helper,
  [ADR 0009](docs/decisions/0009-board-column-permissions.md) role matrix, design tokens
  (light/dark), Archivo/Fraunces/JetBrains typography, shadcn primitives, board list and
  board page shell with column dialogs.
- Phase 0 documentation and standards: governance files, process docs, architecture docs,
  ADRs 0001–0008, EN/TR mirrors, and repository branch protection / merge defaults.
- Phase 1 monorepo skeleton: pnpm workspace (`apps/api`, `apps/web`,
  `packages/shared-types`), NestJS + Prisma schema/migration/seed, Next.js + next-intl
  placeholder login, Docker Compose, and CI workflow.
- Phase 2 auth and workspaces: Better Auth (organization plugin) on Nest `/auth/*`,
  `GET /me`, session/workspace/role guards, workspace CRUD + invitations, web
  login/register/invite + workspace switcher, and auth/isolation/role-matrix tests.
- `@kurultay/auth-access` — shared Better Auth organization access-control roles for api
  and web.
- Shared Prisma/`pg` pool for Nest and Better Auth; FK and list query indexes migration;
  workspace-nested scaffold routes (`/workspaces/:workspaceId/...`).
- Web: typed Nest API client, Next.js middleware session gate, layout split
  (`WorkspaceProvider` / `AppSidebar` / `AppShell`).
- CI `format:check` (Prettier) on every PR.

### Changed

- Nest `/workspaces` is the sole public API for organization/workspace mutations; Better
  Auth `/auth/organization/*` mutation paths are HTTP-firewalled (reads + `set-active`
  remain).
- Pagination docs: cursor `CursorPage<T>` is the shared typed default; no `OffsetPage`
  export.
- Product enums in `@kurultay/shared-types` include `InvitationStatus` and
  `LabelColorSlot` (`slot-1`…`slot-8`); invitation DTO status is no longer a free string.
- ESLint docs aligned with the flat config actually shipped (no Nest/Next/import plugins
  yet).
